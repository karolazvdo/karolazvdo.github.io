::: {#my-heading}

*A biologist and biodiversity researcher, currently completing my PhD. My work focuses on knowledge shortfalls, macroecology, and human-nature interactions, with an emphasis on protected areas and environmental perception. I'm also a science communicator and environmental educator, bringing ecology and conservation closer to young audiences and the broader public.*
